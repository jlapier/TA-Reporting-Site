Performance Measures

Key Features:
A report builder, where staff can specify start and end date and which fields they want in the report. The report should provide an HTML preview and an Excel export. Staff can also click on a record within the report view and edit the record (without leaving the page, through the use of AJAX).

Examples of possible reports (and pre-defined reports):

* Counts of activities in various categories for monthly/annual reporting
* All activities with a selected state in a given period of time
* All activities under a specific objective in a given period of time
* All activities under a specific level of intensity in a given period of time
* A combination of specific fields
* ... etc.



A contact management system (directory) of some kind. Will want to link contacts to activities in some cases.

Product tracking... (to be defined)
(start and end date of development, date of OSEP approval; name, brief description; contractor/collaborators)
